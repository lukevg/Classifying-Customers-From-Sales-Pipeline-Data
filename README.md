# Classifying-Customers-From-Sales-Pipeline-Data

This is a classification project done for a Chicago tech company to help them identify and predict which accounts in their sales pipeline will become end customers. They used my findings to modify their outreach efforts and classification of some accounts. 

To arrive at my findings, I ran a variety of classification models such as logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and tree models, and used some resampling methods to deal with the unbalanced classes.

The data I received was messy enough that I was advised by instructors to not work with this data set, so it felt like a major accomplishment to clean the data well enough to model. However, I cannot share that piece of the project publicly since I signed an NDA and part of the data cleaning process was making a lot of changes to avoid identifying the company. I would be happy to talk more about the cleaning process with anyone who is interested. 

I have included the code for my models, as well as PowerPoint slides which give some insight into my process, findings, and recommendations. My blog repo contains a post that explains the project in more detail.
